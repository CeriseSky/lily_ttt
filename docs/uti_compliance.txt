UTI (Universal Tic-Tac-Toe Interface) by me, based on UCI
I would recommend reading the UCI documentation before this

The main difference between this and UCI is that the engine should not
respond to UTI commands from the GUI until it is ready as there is no isready
command

Move notation is a single letter from A to I, which corresponds as follows
(Best viewed with a monospace font)
A | B | C
--+---+--
D | E | F
--+---+--
G | H | I
The engine can also send X which is the nullmove that skips its turn. This is
for testing only and should not be treated as a legal move by the engine.

Position is sent as a string of all previous moves where X goes first.
For example, "position EGADCB" codes for:
X | O |X 
--+---+--
O | X |  
--+---+--
O |   |
